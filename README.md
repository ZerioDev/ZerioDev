Hi there ! 

I'm a very young French developer who loves JS !

Having started developing a few years ago, I have been able to acquire a lot of knowledge.

Unfortunately, I'm not too active on my GitHub anymore, I deleted many projects and the active ones are not updated anymore.
I have to advance in my studies, that's why I put all this little world aside for the moment.
I will come back active in a while no worries.

My discord server is currently still active, and maintained by a great community that continues to grow.

Support me ‚ù§Ô∏è

All my donations will be used to finance my projects.
